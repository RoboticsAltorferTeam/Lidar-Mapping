If catkin_make failed with errors, check error and usually it's due to dependencies... Install them and compile it again...

Usually need to install these
#Dependencies
#Missing "Pcl" package
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-pcl-ros
#Missing "pcap.h" headler file
sudo apt-get install libpcap0.8-dev

catkin_make

source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch velodyne_pointcloud VLP16_points.launch

roscd velodyne_pointcloud/
cd launch
sudo nano VLP16_points.launch

add following line to properly link VLP16 to the robot at the end of launch file just before </launch> line.

<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="velodyne_broadcaster" args="0 0 0.145 0 0 0 mid_mount velodyne 10"/>

To add velodyne launch file to automatically launch at robot startup.

cd
roscd velodyne_pointcloud/
cd launch
sudo cp VLP16_points.launch /etc/ros/indigo/ros.d

cd

sudo nano /etc/ros/setup.bash

comment source and add new source path
source /home/administrator/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

sudo reboot

rostopic list
if it shows velodyne topics, you are good to go.....
